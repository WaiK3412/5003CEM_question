OVERVIEW

This repository contains my solutions for the Data Structures and Algorithms course assignment. The assignment demonstrates the implementation and analysis of three fundamental data structures: Hash Tables, Graphs, and Multithreading.


ASSIGNMENT STRUCTURE

The assignment consists of three main questions:

Question 1: Hash Table Implementation for Product Management
Question 2: Graph Implementation for Social Media Network
Question 3: Multithreading for Factorial Calculation


FILES IN THIS REPOSITORY

Question_1.py
  Implements a hash table data structure using separate chaining for collision resolution.
  Features include adding products, searching by ID, and displaying all products.
  Demonstrates understanding of hash functions and collision handling.

Question_2.py
  Implements a directed graph data structure representing a social media network.
  Features include adding users, creating follow relationships, viewing followers and following lists.
  Demonstrates understanding of graph theory and adjacency list representation.

Question_3.py
  Implements multithreaded factorial calculation using Python's threading module.
  Compares single-threaded vs multi-threaded performance for different input sizes.
  Demonstrates understanding of concurrent programming and thread synchronization.
